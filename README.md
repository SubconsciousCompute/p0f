# p0f 

Version 3.09b + CMake + Minor Tweaks.

This is a personal fork of [p0f](https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/p0f3/). `p0f` is
written and maintained by a super-human named Michal Zalewski. 

I added a cmake build system and CI pipeline. Some other improvements were also
added which are enumerated in CHANGELOG.md file.

See the `docs/README` file from the original distribution for details.
